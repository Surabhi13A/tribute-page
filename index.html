        <p id="bio">Without Tesla, you might not be able to affordably power your home, let alone read this sentence.
            He is a man who came from nowhere yet became world famous; claimed to be devoted solely to discovery but relished 
            the role of a showman; attracted the attention of many women but never married; and generated ideas that transformed 
            daily life and created multiple fortunes but died nearly penniless.<br/>
            Tesla filed more than 300 patents during his 86 years of life and his inventions helped pave the way for alternating 
            currents(AC), electric motors, radios, floroscent lights, lasers among many other things.
            Some of his ideas later in life, however, seems strange even now. He once described plans for a death ray, for example,
            and eluded another idea to the impenetrable "wall of force" to block and destroy foreign invasions.

                        <p><strong>July 10, 1856</strong>:  Nikola Tesla is born
                        <br/>Nikola Tesla was born in Smiljan, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His parents were ethnic 
                           Serbians. His father was an Orthodox Priest, and he credited his mother for his inventiveness.</p>

                        <p><strong>1875</strong>:  Tesla Enrolled at Austrian Polytechnic
                        <br/>In 1875, Tesla began to study engineering at the Austrian Polytechnic in Graz, Austria. He claimed to
                           have graduated, but the institution disagrees.

                        <p><strong>1882</strong>:  Worked for Continental Edison
                        <br/>In 1882, he went to work for Continental Edison in Paris. He was attempting to improve on electrical 
                            equipment sent from the United States.</p>

                        <p><strong>1882</strong>:  Identified Magnetic Induction Field Principle
                        <br/>Working independently, Tesla identified the rotating magnetic induction field principle. This is used today
                         in alternators.</p>

                        <p><strong>1884</strong>:  Moved to United States
                        <br/>Tesla moved to the United States in 1884, immediately approaching Thomas Edison with a letter of introduction.
                         According to Tesla, he was offered 50,000 dollars to solve a problem, but Edison never paid. </p>

                        <p><strong>1885</strong>:  Nikola Tesla Quit Working for Edison
                        <br/>After Edison refused to pay, Tesla quit working for Edison, with the plan and intention of starting his own 
                        electrical company.</p>

                        <p><strong>1886</strong>:  Began Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing
                        <br/>Tesla founded the Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company in Rahway, New Jersey. He invented and 
                        marketed an arc lamp; however, he earned relatively little off of his investment. </p>

                        <p><strong>1887</strong>:  War of Currents
                        <br/>The War of Currents began in 1887. Direct current, invented and supported by Edison, was in direct 
                        competition with Tesla's alternating current.</p>

                        <p><strong>1891</strong>:  Patented Tesla Coil
                        <br>n 1891, Tesla patented the Tesla Coil. The Tesla Coil is a resonant transformer circuit that produced
                         a high voltage, low current and high frequency alternating current electricity.</p>

                        <p><strong>1891</strong>:  Columbian Exhibition
                        <br/>With the support of the Westinghouse Company, Tesla's alternating current powered the World's
                         Columbian Exhibition. Tesla had offered a lower cost electrical solution.</p>

                        <p><strong>1901</strong>: Construction on Wardenclyffe Tower Began 
                        <br/>In 1901, construction began on the Wardenclyffe Tower. Tesla believed that he could transmit 
                        electrical energy over long distances wirelessly, and the tower would illustrate that. The project 
                        was never fully completed.</p>

                        <p><strong>1915</strong>:  Files Suit Against Guglielmo Marconi
                        <br/>On August 4, 1915, Tesla filed suit against Guglielmo Marconi. Marconi is typically credited with
                         radio transmission; however, Tesla accomplished this before Marconi. </p>

                        <p><strong>1934</strong>:  Particle Beam Research
                        <br/>In 1934, the New York Times published Tesla's particle beam research. While he was not financially
                         successful, he continued to be a relatively prominent voice in the scientific community.</p>

                        <br/>On January 7, 1943, as World War II raged, Nikola Tesla died in the hotel he made his home.
                         Upon his death, the U.S. government immediately seized his papers and research.</p>

                        <p><strong>1960</strong>:  A Tesla Was Defined as a Unit of Measurement
                        <br/> In 1960, the scientific community recognized Tesla's achievements by defining a Tesla as a unit
                         of measurement. A Tesla is a unit of magnetic field B.</p>
